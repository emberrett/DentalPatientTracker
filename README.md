# DentalPatientTracker
Website designed for a dentist and his/her assistants to track which rooms are ready for a visit.

This was part of a college project to provide a local dentist with a means of tracking which rooms/patients in the dental office are ready for a visit. The dentist is granted admin access (IKAdmin), and the assistants given view-only access (IKUser). When a room is ready, an assistant will simply click the "ready" button, which would send a text message to the dentist notifying him/her that the patient in room # is ready. The central interface for the dentist/assistants is a live table that shows how long rooms have been waiting, and which ones are vacant. The dentist can add or delete rooms via an edit feature.

This project was completed using PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and JavaScript. I was the sole programmer and primary designer on this project.
